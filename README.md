# 50 Projects in 50 days

This is a project where I code along Brad Traversy on his course available on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/). There are 50 projects to be completed in 50 days.

At the moment, I have added just a header to identify what I've done but at the end of the course, I will modify it to experiment with it.

I will let you guys know once I start modifying the projects
